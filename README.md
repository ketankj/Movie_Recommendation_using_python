About the Project
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to help users discover new movies based on their preferences. By entering a movie title, users receive a list of similar or recommended movies. Each recommendation is clickable, allowing users to see more detailed information such as genre, director, cast, and an overview.

Features
Top 10 Similar Movies: Recommends the top 10 movies similar to the userâ€™s favorite.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Uses cosine similarity to calculate movie similarity based on selected features.
Error Handling: Handles user input errors by finding the closest match to the entered movie name.
Textual Data Processing: Works with textual movie data to create feature vectors and compare them numerically.
Interactive UI: Recommendations are presented with an appealing, responsive design.
Modal Display: Each movie recommendation provides additional details (e.g., genres, director, cast) in a popup modal.
Dynamic Styling: The frontend includes dynamic and visually engaging styling with animations and overlays for an enhanced user experience.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

Frontend:
HTML (index.html): Sets up the structure of the web page, including the form for user input and the section for displaying recommendations.
CSS (style.css): Defines the look and feel of the application, with styling for layout, colors, animations, and responsiveness.
Backend:
Python (web.py): Handles server-side operations, processing requests for movie recommendations and fetching detailed information about each movie.
Data Requirements
The code requires a CSV file with movie data, containing the following columns:

genres
keywords
tagline
cast
director
overview
original_language
title
index
