# Movie_Recomendation_using Python
Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains a Python-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to the one entered by the user. The system is powered by content-based filtering, leveraging features like genres, keywords, cast, and more to calculate similarity scores and recommend movies.

Features:
Recommends the top 10 movies similar to the userâ€™s favorite.
Uses cosine similarity to calculate movie similarity based on selected features.
Handles user input errors by finding the closest match to the entered movie name.
Works with textual movie data to create feature vectors and compare them numerically.
Data Requirements:
The code requires a CSV file with movie data, including the following columns:
genres
keywords
tagline
cast
director
overview
original_language
title
index
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
numpy
pandas
sklearn
difflib
scikit-learn
Installation:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
